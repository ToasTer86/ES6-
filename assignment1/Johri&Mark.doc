Assignment 1 HW:


Write a user space program to read the RTC, describe your findings:

First we tried a simple C++ program that uses the “ /dev/rtc/” directory. As expected this worked like charm, although this was not the goal of the assignment.

To read the RTC from userspace we have to use the CMOS register. Some google results later we arrived at the following page for the CMOS RTC addresses : http://stanislavs.org/helppc/cmos_ram.html and using this site we got some program examples: 
http://kernelx.weebly.com/cmos.html although this website was using DOS defined variables. Using the unix MANpages  we found out that  “ outportb == outb “ for linux users.

It turned out that reading the CMOS is also not the way to go, although we did learn some interesting facts, now we know we should read the registers and write them into a variable and try to print them.

To test this we are going to write a user space program that will write an int. We will print the memory address of this int and try to write to this memory address from a different user space program. The mmu should not allow us to do this and give us a segmention fault.
For example our first user space program created and reserved the int on the following memory address : 0xbfa835cc
